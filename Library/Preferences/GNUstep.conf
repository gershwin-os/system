# This is the GNUstep configuration file.

# This is the "strict version 2 mode" version of the file, which is
# identical to the normal one, but all the obsolete v1 variables
# (GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT, GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT, GNUSTEP_NETWORK_ROOT,
# GNUSTEP_USER_DIR) have been removed.

# Any line starting with a '#' is a comment.
# Empty lines are ignored.
# Every other line in this file must be of the form
#   XXX=YYY
# where there should be no spaces around the '=' (this is because we
# include this file in shell scripts and makefiles, and sh syntax
# requires no spaces around the '=').
#
# Standard sh quotes can be used in YYY but only at runtime; they can 
# not be used while building.

# GNUstep can use up to 4 domains at the same time.  They are System,
# Local, Network and User.  You can install your programs / resources
# in any of these domains.  This file mostly deals with configuring
# how the domains map to your filesystem.

# IMPORTANT: Don't delete lines from this file unless you want
# the values hardcoded in the packages to be used.  If you want
# to suppress the network domain, set all its paths to be the same
# as the system domain.  If you want to suppress the local domain,
# set all its paths to be the same as the network domain.  If you
# want to suppress the user domain, set its paths to be the same
# as the local domain.  You can not suppress the system domain.

# The paths should not include a '/' at the end.

# The name of the user config file.  This file can override
# some settings in this file.  Usually used by users that want
# to install things into their GNUstep user domain and/or have
# many such domains.
